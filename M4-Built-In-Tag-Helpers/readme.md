# Form Processing Tag Helpers

Clips 1 to 10 are all in the same directory.  There is no reason to have separate files for each clip as there are no changes clip t clip that would be lost. That is, in other parts of the course, teaching is done by progression meaning that what is created in clip 2 my replace what is in clip 1 and if we only had clip 2, you would not have source for what was done in clip 1.  For built in tag helpers, each tag helper stands on its own so not separate clips are required.

However, Clips 11,12 and 13 are all about the new **Tag Helper Components and Custom Tag Helper Components** and there is learning by progression so these clips are separate.  Also, clip 11 starts a brand new visual studio project and does not build on clip 10 so keep that in mind.
