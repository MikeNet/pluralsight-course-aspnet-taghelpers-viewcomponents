When I first started working on this Tag Helpers course, ASP.NET Core 
was still in preview release and the only IDE available to build Tag 
Helpers was Visual Studio 2015 with pre-release tooling.  Since then,
a lot has changed.

First, I want to be 100% clear that everything in this course is based
on the production released version of ASP.NET Core Version 1.  All 
the demonstrations I show during this course are built with Visual 
Studio 2015 which included a pre-release of the ASP.NET Core tooling.
 
Now that Visual Studio 2017 has been released, Microsoft has chosen not 
to support the pre-release tooling in Visual Studio 2015 for ASP.NET Core,
and has gone on to recommend that all ASP.NET Core development be done 
in Visual Studio 2017.

To insure that you will be able to run the demonstration on your computer 
in a Microsoft supported configuration, I’ve include all the download files,
that is the visual studio projects associated with each module, in Visual 
Studio 2017 format.

After installing Visual Studio 2017, you will still need to install the
“Razor Languages Service” extension using nuget.  The projects will work
without this extension, but you will miss out some nice Tag Helper
extensions that I use throughout the course using the older pre-release
version of Visual Studio. Again, everything I show in Tag Helpers in this 
course is exactly what you will find when developing with Visual Studio 2017
and ASP.NET Core Version 1.

If you do have any issues, feel free to contact me by way of the discussion 
section in this course and I’ll do my best to help get your on your way to 
learning Tag Helpers.
