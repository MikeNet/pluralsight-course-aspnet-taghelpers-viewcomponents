    <p>Do you work in a role where your target user is a developer, is in devops, or is an architect? Responsibilities that used to be focused in "Developer Relations" have expanded across many cross-functional roles that live in docs, engineering, product, support, marketing, customer success, training, partner ecosystem, and many other areas.</p>
    <p>DevXcon 2017 is the first end-to-end event that brings together practitioners in this emerging space of Developer Experience. Brought to you by some of the organizers of DevRelCon, DevXcon offers a day of practitioners coming together to share their challenges, solutions, innovations, and visions for where this space will grow.</p>
    <p>Space is limited! Don't miss your chance to meet experts and fellow practitioners of Developer Experience and Developer Relations!</p>
