# Course Code for [ASP.NET Core Tag Helpers and View Components](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/peter-kellner) on Pluralsight

This GitHub repo includes source for all modules of the course that involve code. The code in each sub-folder of the module directory represent the code at the end of that clip. Some clips either do not change source code or do not reference any source code. If that is the case, there may be some folders missing between clips.

All the source code in this course has been built and test with Visual Studio 2019 Express Edition. It should also work with VS Code but has not been tested with that. If you encounter any problems using VS Code please open an issue on this repository.


## Getting Started

It is suggested that you clone or download this repository to your
local computer while you are watching the course. If you are planning on 
watching the course without coding along, this will give you 
a nice view into the source files for all clips that have associated source code.
